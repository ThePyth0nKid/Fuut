### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles, I began by contemplating the strategy for this website, defining the target users and the features/technologies they would desire.

Fuut's target users are:
* Aged 25-50
* Technology enthusiasts and early adopters
* Individuals interested in sustainable and automated food solutions
* Households or businesses looking to modernize their culinary process

What these users would be looking for:
- Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
- Beautiful photos that provide inspiration

### **Structure**

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed.
