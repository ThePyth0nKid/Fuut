### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles, I began by contemplating the strategy for this website, defining the target users and the features/technologies they would desire.

Fuut's target users are:
* Aged 25-50
* Technology enthusiasts and early adopters
* Individuals interested in sustainable and automated food solutions
* Households or businesses looking to modernize their culinary process

What these users would be looking for:
- Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
- Beautiful photos that provide inspiration

### **Structure**

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed.

## Deployment

I deployed this website by using GitPages and following the below steps:

*GitHub pages deployment*

1. Log in to GitHub
2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click 'Settings'
4. Select 'Pages' on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
5. In the source section, select branch 'Master' and save
6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:

Please note it can take a while for this link to become fully active.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
